Your Security Matters
At Password And Security Manager, we take your security seriously. That's why we store your passwords on files instead of a database. This means that your passwords are encrypted and stored safely on your hard drive, where only you can access them. This also means that if you sign into your account on a different device, it will not have your passwords saved there.

When you create a new account or update your password in Password And Security Manager, it's automatically encrypted using our advanced encryption method. Here's an example of how a generic password like "D@ve1sH0t" might look before and after encryption:

Before encryption: D@ve1sH0t
After encryption: Z4FCzKtPfEg70h22R/fHsA==

Offline Capability
The Password and Security Manager has an offline capability that allows users to access their account without an internet connection. The last user who logged in will be saved locally, and if they attempt to log in again with the correct email and password while offline, they will be granted access to their account.

This feature provides added convenience for users who may not always have access to the internet, but still need to manage their passwords securely.
